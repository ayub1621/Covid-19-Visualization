## Introduction
Covid-19 has had a significant impact on the world, and visualizing the data related to Covid-19 can help in understanding the spread and impact of the virus. This program utilizes Python and Plotly, a powerful graphing library, to visualize Covid-19 data in an interactive and informative way.

With this program, you can explore various Covid-19 statistics, such as the number of cases, deaths, and recoveries over time, as well as visualize the data geographically using interactive maps.

## Installation
To run this program, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3
- Jupyter Lab
- Pandas
- Plotly

You can install these dependencies using `pip` by running the following command:

```bash
pip install jupyterlab pandas plotly
```

Once the dependencies are installed, you can clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ayub1621/Covid-19-Visualization.git
cd Covid-19-Visualization
```

## Usage
1. Launch Jupyter Lab by running the following command in the project directory:
   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```

2. In Jupyter Lab, open the `Covid-19 Visualization using Python and Plotly.ipynb` notebook.

3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to load and preprocess the Covid-19 data, and create various visualizations using Plotly.

4. Customize the visualizations based on your requirements. You can modify the data sources, add additional visualizations, or customize the appearance of the graphs.

5. Run the code cells in the notebook to generate the visualizations.
